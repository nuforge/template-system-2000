A template system I developed and used to develop my sites as I learned PHP in the early 2000s.

I would copy the !copy folder and rename it, tweak a few lines and it would pull from the master template system. If I recall correctly.

Not sure how well-coded it was, but I can only imagine its janky as hell. Self-taught through BOOKS and the bronze-age of the internet. I'd love to get some insights or feedback after all these years.

Also... not sure which version this is.
